AdaBoost Classifier and Regressor in Machine Learning
📌 Introduction

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) to form a strong predictive model. It works by training models sequentially, where each new model focuses more on the mistakes made by the previous models.

AdaBoost can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

🔑 Key Concepts

Boosting: Sequentially applying weak learners, each correcting the predecessor’s errors.

Weak Learner: A simple model (like a shallow decision tree) with performance slightly better than random guessing.

Adaptive Weights: Misclassified data points get higher weights, so the next learner pays more attention to them.

Final Prediction: Weighted majority vote (classification) or weighted average (regression).

⚙️ AdaBoost Classifier

Goal: Improve classification accuracy.

👉Algorithm:

Initialize equal weights for all samples.

Train a weak classifier.

Increase weights of misclassified samples.

Combine weak learners into a strong classifier via weighted voting.

👉Use Cases:

Spam detection

Face recognition

Medical diagnosis

⚙️ AdaBoost Regressor

Goal: Improve regression performance.

👉Algorithm:

Initialize weights for all samples.

Train a weak regressor.

Increase weights for poorly predicted samples.

Combine weak regressors into a strong predictor via weighted averaging.

👉Use Cases:

Predicting stock prices

Weather forecasting

Sales prediction

📊 Advantages

Handles both classification and regression.

Reduces bias and variance.

Works well with non-linear data.

Easy to implement and interpret.

⚠️ Limitations

Sensitive to noisy data and outliers.

Requires careful tuning of learning rate and number of estimators.

Computationally more expensive than single models.
